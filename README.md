# U.S.-Farms-Biogas-ML-Prediction-Livestock

In this study, we conducted an in-depth analysis of medium and large-scale animal farms in the United States. 
We carried out various analyses on farms with different animal types (Cattle, Dairy, Poultry, Swine) to determine their biogas production potential. 
By leveraging Machine Learning (ML) models, we aimed to make our biogas production predictions more accurate and impactful.
